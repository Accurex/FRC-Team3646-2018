# FRC-Team3646-2018
This code is written by [me](https://twitter.com/MEAldemir) and [Bartu Oren](https://github.com/bartu-oren-2016400036) collaboratively. Although many autonomous programs are written in the code, few of them were used in the season. Remaining ones are the backup codes in case of one of the sensors required to run a particular autonomous mode malfunctions. The control system contains various failure prevention systems for both mechanical subsystems and electronic components.  
It helped the team to gain a significant amount of ranking points at both the SBPLI Long Island Regional #1 and Houston Championship Roebling Division by performing successful autonomous rounds.
